# LondonPostcodeManager
This project is a London Postcode Manager that implements three different data structures to store and manage postcode data:

BST (Binary Search Tree) – A standard binary search tree (unbalanced).
AVL Tree – A self-balancing binary search tree for efficient searching and insertion.
Min-Heap – A priority queue where the smallest element (by a given metric) is always at the root.
All three implementations support the same core operations, allowing for direct performance comparisons via benchmarking.

## Features

**Common Operations (Supported by All Data Structures)**
- Insert a postcode
- Search for a postcode
- Delete a postcode or Extract Min (for Min-Heap)
- In order traversal
- Count the number of postcodes stored
- 
**Benchmarking**
- Time comparisons for insertions, searches, and deletions
